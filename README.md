German sounds nice.. right? I combined my ambitions for language learning with AI enthusiasm and the idea emerged: predict the gender of German nouns. And include Natural Language Processing concepts. 
My goal was to provide a picture of my workflow and to experience from start to finish. Still there are plenty of detailed explainations and visualizations. 
I tested the Kipling scheme for defining project details and made ToDo lists for various sections. 

The material is getting huge, and there is still place to grow. I am looking forward to create a presentation about my efforts invested in this project.
